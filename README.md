# SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction
This is a Machine Learning classification project that predicts whether an object detected by sonar is a Rock or a Mine (metal). It uses the Sonar dataset which contains 60 features extracted from sonar signals.

## How to Run this Project
### Option 1: Run on Google Colab
1. Open [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
2. Upload `SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb`.
3. Upload SONAR Dataset.csv when required.
4. Run all cells to train and test the model.

### Option 2: Run Locally (Jupyter Notebook)
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction.git
2. Navigate to the folder:
cd SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook
4. Run `SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction.ipynb`.

## Results
- Built a classifier to distinguish between Rocks and Mines using sonar data.
- Achieved good accuracy on the dataset.

## Future Work
- Try advanced models like Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost.
- Perform hyperparameter tuning.
- Deploy the model as a simple web app.
